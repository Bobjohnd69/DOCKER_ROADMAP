The docker run command must specify an IMAGE to derive the container from. An image developer can define image defaults related to:
- detached or foreground running
- container identification
- network settings
- runtime constraints on CPU and memory
With the docker run [OPTIONS] an operator can add to or override the image defaults set by a developer. And, additionally, operators can override nearly all the defaults set by the Docker runtime itself. The operator's ability to override image and Docker runtime defaults is why run has more options than any other docker command.
